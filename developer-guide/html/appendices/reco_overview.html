<h1>MyScriptJS Developer Guide</h1>
<h2>Recognition overview</h2>
<h3>Digital ink as MyScript input</h3>
<p>MyScript performs on-line recognition and works mainly on digital ink as input*. Digital ink can be defined as a series of strokes. A stroke is defined as the trajectory of the pen from the moment it is touching the surface until it is lifted again. It is represented as a sequence of 2D points (XY) ordered by time (T). Digital ink thus refers to a dynamic process that takes into account where strokes start, where strokes end, and in which order they were written.</p>
<p>* Digital ink is not the only input supported by the MyScript engine: It can also recognize strings, characters, music clefs, etc. To see which input is supported, refer to the <code>add</code> methods in the API reference guide.</p>
<h3 id="recognition-process">Text recognition results</h3>
<p>MyScript is based on artificial intelligence and so works mainly on probability. It gives the most probable result it finds, in accordance with the criteria it has to work with. </p>
<p>For recognition of text, the result is delivered as a kind of tree: It is hierarchical.</p>
<p>The result is considered on 3 levels: character, word and text (the whole ink sample). At each level, the recognizer can keep several candidates, or likely alternatives that it also found during its deduction. You can get several recognition candidates, at any level, if you ask for them in the initial request. For example, this could allow your application to provide alternative recognition choices. You can ask in your request to see the different levels of results and ask for a certain number of candidates for each level.</p>
<p>A score is provided, from 0 to 1. The resemblance score reflects the level of confidence in the recognizer's raw output. The normalized score reflects how confident the recognizer is, taking into account all the resources it has used to recognize (dictionaries, lexicons, etc.). It is probably the latter score that you should refer to. </p>
<p class="remark">For Shape and Math, results are more straightforward. For Shape, it is a shape type (e.g. a circle), a set of shape &quot;primitives&quot; (the shape's composing elements) and knowledge on how the shape appears spatially (so it can be reproduced). For Math, it can be a LaTeX or MathML string, which you will have to render yourself if you wish to display it as an image.</p><br>
