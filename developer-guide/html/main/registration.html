<h3>Application and HMAC keys</h3>
<p>If you are working on code samples, both keys have to be pasted in the 'index.html' file of all code samples. Replace the existing keys (<code>var applicationKey</code> and <code>var hmacKey</code>) and run the  code.</p>
  <p>If you are working on your own application, then both keys have to be passed to the <code>doSimpleRecognition</code> method of the <a href="http://doc.myscript.com/MyScriptJS/API_Reference/index.html" target="_blank">recognizer</a>.</p>
  <p class="remark">You may need to pass other parameters depending on how you are invoiced. These parameters allow us to monitor traffic and bill you correctly in accordance with your contract.</p>
