## What is it about?

MyScriptJS is a javascript library that can be used in every web application (whatever javascript framework you are using) to bring handwriting recognition. 
It integrates all you need:  
* Signal capture,
* Nice digital ink rendering,
* Plug with MyScript CDK to bring handwriting recognition.

## Prerequisites

1. Have a MyScript developer account. You can create one [here](https://dev.myscript.com/).
2. Get an application key and HMAC key for your application.

## Installation

1. Download it.

       bower install myscript

2. Import it on your webapp.

```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="../dist/myscript.min.css"/>
    <script src="../dist/myscript.min.js"></script>
```

3. Create an element for your editor.

```html
    <div id="editor"></div>
```

4. Configure it.

```javascript
  var editorElement = document.getElementById('editor');

  MyScript.register(editorElement, {
    recognitionParams: {
      type: 'MATH',
      server: {
        applicationKey: '#YOUR MYSCRIPT CDK APPLICATION KEY#',
        hmacKey: '#YOUR MYSCRIPT CDK HMAC KEY#'
      }
    }
  });
```
   
5. Use it!
