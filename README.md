# MyScriptJS

[MyScriptJS](http://myscript.github.io/MyScriptJS/) is a free and open-source JavaScript library providing an easy way to use [MyScript Cloud]( https://dev.myscript.com/dev-kits/cloud-development-kit/) handwriting recognition in your app.

[MyScriptJS](http://myscript.github.io/MyScriptJS/) speeds up the development of handwriting interfaces with JavaScript, by abstracting and providing default implementations for the common tasks that need to be managed:

* **Ink management**: store strokes and benefit from a built-in undo / redo system.
* **Ink rendering**: attach a renderer to a HTML5 canvas to start capturing and displaying smooth strokes.
* **Call to the recognizer**: MyScriptJS manages the construction of the request to MyScript Cloud and API calls, using REST or WebSocket protocols (new in Cloud 3.0).
* **All MyScript recognition types**: the object model of MyScriptJS supports the recognition of text, math, shapes, music and mixed text and shapes.
* **Result tree parsing**: the recognition result tree is exposed and fully traversable.
* **Typesetting (coming soon)**: replace the ink by the proper digital text, math equation or shape

**TODO : Supported browsers**
