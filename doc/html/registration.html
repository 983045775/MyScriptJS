<h1>MyScript JS Developer Guide</h1>
<h2>Registration</h2>
<p>In order to use MyScript JS, users are required to register with the service. Only requests from valid users will be considered by the HTTP server.</p>
<p>The terms of service and the invoicing method are determined by your user contract. This may determine how you need to send your requests. For example, if your invoicing method involves a user count, you will need to pass user IDs as part of your request. (See the <a href="summary/sending_requests.html" target="main">Sending requests</a> section for details).</p>
<p>To become a valid user, follow the below procedure:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Create an account on the <a href="https://dev.myscript.com/" target="_blank">developer portal</a>.</li>
  <li>Click on the link received by mail to confirm your registration.</li>
  <li>Log in to your account.</li>
  <li>Click <img src="../images/ms_cloud.png"> on the main page.</li>
  <li>Check the box <strong>I want a free 90-day developer license for MyScript Cloud Development Kit </strong>and click <strong>I accept</strong>.</li>
  <li>You will receive an e-mail containing further instructions and explaining how to have the service up and running.</li>
  <li>To download the samples, go back to the developer portal and click again <img src="../images/cdk_samples.png" alt=""></li></ol></blockquote>

  <p>You can now start making requests to the recognition service. The application key supplied must be included in all requests or they will be invalid.</p>
  <p>You may need to pass other parameters depending on how you are invoiced. These parameters allow us to monitor traffic and bill you correctly in accordance with your usage contract.<br>
