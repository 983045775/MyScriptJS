<h1>MyScriptJS Developer Guide</h1>
<h2>Limitations and errors</h2>
<p>MyScript can recognize different types of input, but except for <a href="../recognition/reco_analyzer.html" target="main">Analyzer</a> (Shape + Text), these types cannot be combined in a single request to the same URL. Each request is for a particular type of service.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="../../images/area_triangle.png" style="margin-right:25px;"><img src="../../images/not_equation1.png" style="margin-right:25px;"><img src="../../images/thales.png" style="margin-right:25px;">
  <br>
<span class="remark">Examples of input that would NOT be recognized correctly.</span>
<p>In the above examples,  text, shapes and math expressions are combined in the same request, which is not currently possible. Your application needs to have some way of ensuring that different elements are sent in distinct requests.</p>
<h3>Text limitations</h3>
<p>The Text recognition service:</p>
<ul><ul>
  <li>recognizes also digits, common punctuation and symbols, in the usual style for the given language.</li>
  <li>can only recognize ink samples in the order in which they are sent. Any &quot;reassembly&quot; of parts of a document has to be done in pre-processing. </li>
  <li>can recognize many common items such as many proper names, phone numbers, email addresses, simple Web addresses, with varying degrees of accuracy.</li>
  <li>is case sensitive during recognition. It does not &quot;adjust&quot; the case, so for example if you write in all capitals, the result is highly likely to be all in capitals too. </li>
  <li>recognizes text in one language. You cannot mix for example Russian and Spanish in a single request. However, most languages allow to recognize common &quot;International&quot; English terms. The East Asian languages support some English words appearing mixed in with native Chinese/Korean/Japanese ideograms.</li>
  <li>cannot recognize super- or sub-script.</li>
</ul></ul>
<h3><a name="equation_limitations">Math limitations</a></h3>
<p>The Math recognition service:
<ul><ul>
<li> can recognize math symbols as described <a href="../recognition/reco_math.html" target="main">on the Math recognition page</a>, although we recommend clearly separating the different phases of the Math request,</li>
<li>can recognize equations that are not true equations, or that are improbable,</li>
  <li>can recognize equation elements with almost limitless levels of recursiveness (for example, square roots with subscript),</li>
  <li>can only recognize single equations - but not systems of equations,</li>
  <li>cannot recognize matrices or complex arithmetic layouts like long division,</li>
  <li>cannot recognize other text or characters or shapes: it assumes that its input is always 
  an equation,</li>
  <li>cannot support corrections or ink incidents.</li>
</ul></ul>
<p>There is one specific case that is not supported:</p>
<table class="bordered_table90" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th width="168">Unsupported case</th>
    <th width="427">Description</th>
    <th width="163">Supported alternative</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="table_text_cells"><img src="../../images/not_supported2.png"></td>
    <td>This is not currently supported. The second elements are too close to the first and will not give a correct result (the segmentation of the elements is likely to be incorrect). This type of equation can be recognized but care must be taken to provide adequate spacing. </td>
    <td><span class="table_text_cells"><img src="../../images/supported2.png" alt=""></span></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3><a name="shape_limitations">Shape limitations</a></h3>
<p>The Shape recognition service:</p>
<ul><ul>
  <li> can recognize only the <a href="supported.html#shape" target="main">supported shapes</a>,</li>
  <li> can recognize simple diagrams, organization drawings, freehand drawings, etc.,</li>
  <li>cannot recognize text items mixed with shapes,</li>
  <li>cannot recognize complex shapes        such as diagrams for electronics or engineering, maps, architectural plans and so on. </li></ul></ul>
  <p class="remark">Connectors will be created on the beautified shapes to make them as geometrically attractive as possible. If lines and shapes are very close, it will tend to make them touch to create an illusion of connection.</p>
<h3><a name="analyzer_limitations">Analyzer limitations</a></h3>
<p>The Analyzer recognition service can recognize only 2 types of input: Shape and Text.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="../../images/area_triangle.png" style="margin-right:25px;"><img src="../../images/not_equation1.png" style="margin-right:25px;"> <br>
<span class="remark">Examples of input that would NOT be recognized correctly.</span>
<p>The Analyzer recognition service:</p>
<ul><ul>
  <li>complies with the Text and Shape limitations described above.</li>
  <li>can recognize text mixed with simple diagrams, organization drawings, freehand drawings, etc. </li>
  <li>cannot recognize complex shapes such as diagrams for electronics or engineering, maps, architectural plans and so on. </li>
  <li>cannot recognize Math items.</li>
</ul></ul>
<p class="remark">Connectors will often be created on the beautified shapes to make them as geometrically attractive as possible. If lines and shapes are very close, it will tend to make them touch to create an illusion of connection.</p>
<h3>Potential errors</h3>
<p>Besides <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xml" target="_blank">standard HTTP errors</a>, some API-specific exceptions may occur.</p>
