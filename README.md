## What is it about?

MyScriptJS is a javascript library that can be used in every web application (whatever javascript framework you are using) to bring handwriting recognition. 
It integrates all you need:  
* Signal capture,
* Nice digital ink rendering,
* Plug with MyScript Cloud to bring handwriting recognition.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

1. Have [bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower) installed.
Have a MyScript developer account. You can create one [here](https://developer.myscript.com/).
2. Get your keys and the free monthly quota to access MyScript Cloud at [developer.myscript.com](https://developer.myscript.com)

### Installation

1. Download MyScriptJS library
```shell
bower install myscript
```

```

4. In the body create a `div` that will contain the editing zone

```

5. In javascript, create the editor attached to editor DOM Node
