<p><strong>MyScriptJS</strong> is a free set of Javascript libraries, used to provide an <span class="token important">easy and quick implementation</span> of online handwriting recognition. It works directly with <strong>MyScript Cloud</strong>, but its role is to simplify its access. Where MyScript Cloud needs a *.json request to be manually created from A to Z, MyScriptJS only needs a valid application key, ink coordinates (XY) and possibly their corresponding timestamp (T).
<p>MyScriptJS is available for free on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and includes API reference and a Getting Started Guide.
  To learn more about MyScript Cloud, see the <a href="../doc.myscript.com/myscript-cloud" target="_blank">corresponding documentation</a>.
<p>See below a brief overview of the MyScript recognition process:

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>To make requests using MyScriptJS, you need:</p>
<ul><ul>
  <li>strong JavaScript skills,</li>

<li>an application key and a HMAC key, which are provided once you register (see <a href="registration.html" target="main">Registration</a> page),</li>
<li>a good understanding of the MyScript main concepts, namely: <strong>stroke</strong>, <strong>renderer</strong>, <strong>ink manager</strong> and <strong>recognizer</strong> (see the <a href="concepts.html">Main concepts</a> page),</li>
<li>an Internet connection, in order for requests to be sent and received to and from the server. However the application does not need to be Web-based.</li>
