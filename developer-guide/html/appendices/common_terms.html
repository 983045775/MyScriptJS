  <tr>
    <td><b>Candidate</b></td>
    <td><p>Refers to a recognition candidate: The recognizer keeps in memory all the alternatives it has considered during the recognition process (e.g. &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;cal&quot;, &quot;eat&quot;). These alternatives are called candidates.</p></td>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Digital ink</b></td>
    <td><p>Hand-drawn strokes that are captured digitally via a touch screen, stylus device or other digital writing implement. The strokes are an array of points, their ink coordinates (XY) and possibly their corresponding timestamp (T).</p></td>

    <td width="22%"><b>Recognition</b></td>
    <td width="78%">Process of turning digital ink into machine-readable elements such as digital text or vector shapes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Resource</b></td>
    <td>Internal information used within the MyScript recognizer. This can be a dictionary or lexicon, a language resource that helps it convert a certain language, etc. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Result</b></td>
    <td><p>This is the result of the MyScript engine's recognition process. The end result is the final choice  for the whole ink sample. For text, however, you can obtain more of the hierarchical tree that constitutes the result by asking to see x candidates at various levels.</p></td>
